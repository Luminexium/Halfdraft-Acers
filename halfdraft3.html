<p> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Halfdraft Acres has been open since 2009 and all the horses these people have saved out of the goodness of their hearts could keep growing but, the number is staying still for now and we need volunteers to help get that number growing again.
Halftdraft acres is a peaceful ranch anyone could just come and bond with a horse.
